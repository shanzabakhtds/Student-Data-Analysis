# Student-Data-Analysis

    Description:

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of student data, focusing on key attributes such as gender, race, and academic performance metrics including GPA and scores in various mathematics courses. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, provided a rich source of information for exploring patterns and trends related to student success.

    Key Components:

1) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Employed statistical and graphical methods to unveil patterns, trends, and anomalies within the student dataset. Conducted thorough data cleaning, handled missing values, and identified outliers to ensure data integrity.

 2) Data Visualization:
 Utilized powerful visualization tools such as  Matplotlib, Seaborn, and pyplot to create insightful charts, graphs, and dashboards. These visual representations effectively communicated complex trends, facilitating a deeper understanding of the data for stakeholders.

 3) Academic Performance Analysis:
 Examined academic performance metrics, including GPA trends, and scores in Algebra, Calculus 1, Calculus 2, Statistics, Probability, Measure, and Functional Analysis. Identified factors influencing student success in specific courses.

4) Demographic Insights:
Explored demographic data including gender and race to understand the diversity of the student population. Analyzed correlations between demographic factors and academic outcomes to inform educational strategies and policies.

       Results:
Uncovered correlations between academic performance and specific demographic factors.
Identified trends in performance across different mathematics courses.
Visualized the distribution of GPAs and scores in various subjects, providing actionable insights for targeted educational interventions.

     Impact:
The findings from this project offer valuable insights for educators, administrators, and policymakers to tailor educational strategies based on gender, race, and academic performance. The data-driven approach employed contributes to evidence-based decision-making in the education sector.

This project not only showcased proficiency in data analysis and visualization but also demonstrated the potential for leveraging data to drive positive changes in mathematics education.
